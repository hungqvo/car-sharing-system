----- This was a 4 member team effort. The other 3 members were responsible for Task A and B. My part that I volunteered to do is Task C and D (and design all UI UX for this project)

MY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS PROJECT:

1/ Designed UI and UX for both AP (Client Raspberry Pi) and Web App Booking UI. The html and css is in CustomerWebApp templates (Under Task A FOLDER in the left hand side explorer).

> HTML and CSS for Web App PATH: /CAR-SHARING-SYSTEM/Task A/CustomerWebApp/templates

> The UI UX designs PATH: /CAR-SHARING-SYSTEM/MY UI DESIGNS

2/ Finished Task C and D. Please refer to the Project Description and Requirements (by our lecturer) in the PIoT_Assignment2.pdf located in the HOME directory (/CAR-SHARING-SYSTEM). The UI for AP (raspberry pi client-side) is made and converted into Python PyQT library by QT Designer Studio (QT Framework for Python). 

> The UI Python file PATH: /CAR-SHARING-SYSTEM/TASK C & D/ap-code/ap-gui/screen_organizer.py

3/ The project was hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Because GCP charges fees for any hosted project, our team had to use our credit card to use GCP on trial. After the project was marked, the hosting was turned off, but all related code files are stored here in the project repository. 

Thank you very much for reviewing, I hope to be working with your team!
